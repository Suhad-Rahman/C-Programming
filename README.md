# Linear Search on Random Array in C

This project demonstrates the **Linear Search algorithm** using the C programming language. The program generates an array of 50 random integers (between 0 and 30), prints the array, and asks the user to search for a specific number.

It then displays:
- All positions where the number appears
- The total number of times it was found

---

## ðŸ›  Features

- Random number generation with `rand()`
- Linear search implementation
- Clear output of positions and count
- Simple and beginner-friendly C code

---

## ðŸ–¥ Sample Output

```
The Array = 7 14 3 7 29 ...
Search for = 7

Element 7 is found at Position 1!!
Element 7 is found at Position 4!!

Element 7 is found 2 times.
```

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Compile the code:
   ```
   gcc search.c -o search
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```
   ./search
   ```
