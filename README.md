## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

You can use this repo to:

- Browse beginner to advanced examples
- See output samples for each program
- Understand logic through comments
- Run the code on your machine for practice

> 💡 Tip: Use an IDE like **Code::Blocks**, **Dev C++**, or **VS Code** with a C compiler (e.g., GCC) to run the `.c` files.

## 🛠 How to Run a C File

1. Make sure you have GCC installed.  
   On Linux/macOS:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output
   ```

   On Windows (with Code::Blocks or similar):  
   Just press **Build & Run**.

2. Example:
   ```bash
   gcc hello_world.c -o hello
   ./hello
   ```
